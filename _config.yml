  "I love making art out of gourds. I do comission work, along
  with teaching classes. I especially like working with teenagers.I recently
  volunteered my services, demonstrating the process of the Ni'ihau method of
  Ipu dying, as a learning experience to the kids at The Lanakila Learning
  Center, an alternative learning center of Hilo High School."
